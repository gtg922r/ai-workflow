## Progress

[10:02:46] Starting work on story: Gemini Command: Limerick Generator
[10:02:46] Beginning iteration 1
- **Decision** [10:03:35]: Used a prescriptive prompt for the limerick generator to ensure strict adherence to the AABBA rhyme scheme and rhythmic structure, while also handling missing arguments gracefully by providing usage instructions.
- **Learning** [10:03:35]: Grouping creative commands under `commands/gemini/creative/` continues the organizational pattern established by the `poem` and `haiku` stories, making the command library easier to navigate as it grows.
[10:03:35] Iteration 1 completed: ```
