## Progress

[09:34:24] Starting work on story: Gemini Command: 7-Line Poem Generator
[09:34:24] Beginning iteration 2
[09:45:00] Created poem command in commands/gemini/creative/poem.toml
[09:45:10] Updated README.md with new command
[09:45:20] Updated prd.json to mark story as complete
[09:45:30] Verified project structure and installer compatibility
- **Decision** [09:35:22]: Created a new `creative` directory for Gemini commands to provide a logical grouping for non-workflow tools, anticipating the addition of more creative commands like `haiku` and `limerick`.
- **Decision** [09:35:22]: Implemented the `poem` command with specific prompt instructions to ensure the output is exactly 7 lines and contains no additional conversational text, meeting the requirement for a clean, readable output.
- **Learning** [09:35:22]: The Gemini CLI command format (TOML) is highly effective for defining reusable prompts that can be easily shared and installed across different environments using the project's NPX installer.
[09:35:22] Iteration 2 completed: ```
