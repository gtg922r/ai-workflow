## Progress

[10:03:36] Starting work on story: Gemini Command: 7-Line Poem Generator
[10:03:36] Beginning iteration 2
[16:40:00] Verified `poem.toml` in `commands/gemini/creative/`
[16:40:00] Updated `prd.json` to mark `command-poem-5` as completed
[16:40:00] Finalizing story
- **Decision** [10:04:57]: Verified the existing `poem.toml` implementation in `commands/gemini/creative/` meets all acceptance criteria for `command-poem-5`, ensuring consistency with the creative command grouping pattern.
- **Learning** [10:04:57]: The duplication of stories in the PRD (like `command-poem-7` and `command-poem-5`) can occur when tasks are re-run or split; verifying existing implementations before starting new work prevents redundant coding effort.
[10:04:57] Iteration 2 completed: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
