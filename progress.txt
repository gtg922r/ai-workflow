[2026-01-14 23:23:50] Run #1 [runner-git]: ✓ Completed (369.7s)
   Summary: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

[2026-01-14 23:23:50] 📋 Decision: Used conventional commit format `feat({story_id}): {story_title}` for automatic commits to align with repository conventions in AGENTS.md

[2026-01-14 23:23:50] 📋 Decision: Made git management optional via `--no-git` flag to support non-git repositories or manual git workflows

[2026-01-14 23:23:50] 💡 Learning: The runner needs to track story changes via `last_story_id` to avoid recreating branches on every iteration for the same story

[2026-01-14 23:28:57] Run #2 [runner-review]: ✓ Completed (305.5s)
   Summary: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

[2026-01-14 23:28:57] 📋 Decision: Used `<verdict>APPROVE|REJECT</verdict>` markers (similar to the existing `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` pattern) for review verdicts to maintain consistency with the codebase's marker-based signal extraction approach.

[2026-01-14 23:33:14] Run #3 [runner-prompts]: ✓ Completed (255.9s)
   Summary: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

[2026-01-14 23:33:14] 📋 Decision: Used `story_type` as the Python field name (rather than `type`) to avoid shadowing the built-in `type()` function, while keeping `type` as the JSON key for cleaner PRD files.

[2026-01-14 23:33:14] 📋 Decision: Template resolution checks project root first (for both type-specific and generic) before bundled templates, allowing users to customize any template by placing it in their project root.

[2026-01-14 23:58:52] Run #1 [installer-npx]: ✓ Completed (279.4s)
   Summary: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

[2026-01-14 23:58:52] 📋 Decision: Used @inquirer/prompts (modern, minimal) instead of inquirer (legacy, larger) for the interactive CLI to keep dependencies lightweight and aligned with the "minimalist" requirement.

[2026-01-14 23:58:52] 📋 Decision: Implemented symlink as the recommended installation method with copy as fallback, allowing users to choose. Symlinks auto-update when the source repo is updated, which is ideal for development workflows.

[2026-01-14 23:58:52] 📋 Decision: Commands are Gemini-specific per the existing repository structure, while skills are cross-agent (Gemini, Claude, Codex) following the provider conventions documented in PROVIDERS.md.

[2026-01-14 23:58:52] ✓ Story Completed [installer-npx]: Interactive NPX-based Installer

[2026-01-15 00:05:37] Run #2 [runner-ui-polish]: ✓ Completed (403.2s)
   Summary: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

[2026-01-15 00:05:37] 📋 Decision: Created a dedicated console.py module rather than inline styling to provide clean separation of concerns and enable reuse of UI components across the runner codebase.

[2026-01-15 00:05:37] 📋 Decision: Used Rich library for terminal output compatibility - it handles ANSI escape codes and unicode rendering across different terminal emulators automatically.

[2026-01-15 00:05:37] ✓ Story Completed [runner-ui-polish]: Polished Console UI for Runner Ralph
📋 Decision: Created a dedicated console.py module rather than inline styling to provide clean separation of concerns and enable reuse of UI components across the runner codebase.
📋 Decision: Used Rich library for terminal output compatibility - it handles ANSI escape codes and unicode rendering across different terminal emulators automatically.

[2026-01-15 00:08:44] Run #3 [runner-rename-ralph]: ✓ Completed (186.4s)
   Summary: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

[2026-01-15 00:08:44] 📋 Decision: Used "Runner Ralph" as the new name to maintain alliteration and brand consistency with the existing `ralph.py` script filename, while distinguishing from the original "Ralph Wiggum" Simpsons reference.

[2026-01-15 00:08:45] ✓ Story Completed [runner-rename-ralph]: Unified Renaming to Runner Ralph
📋 Decision: Used "Runner Ralph" as the new name to maintain alliteration and brand consistency with the existing `ralph.py` script filename, while distinguishing from the original "Ralph Wiggum" Simpsons reference.

[2026-01-15 00:10:13] Run #4 [command-workflow-doctor]: ✓ Completed (87.6s)
   Summary: **Usage**: Once installed, invoke with `/workflow:workflow-doctor` in Gemini CLI. Optionally pass context via args (e.g., `/workflow:workflow-doctor f

[2026-01-16 09:34:23] Run #1 [command-workflow-doctor]: ✓ Completed (75.6s)
   Summary: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

[2026-01-16 09:34:23] 📋 Decision: Enhanced `workflow-doctor.toml` to specifically check for `ai-workflow` repository components in global agent configuration directories (~/.gemini, etc.). This ensures that symlinks or copies from this specific project are correctly identified and reported.

[2026-01-16 09:34:23] 💡 Learning: The Gemini CLI's `!{command}` syntax allows for powerful self-diagnosing commands. Using `grep "ai-workflow"` on `find -ls` output is an effective way to verify that local project components are correctly linked into the agent's global configuration.

[2026-01-16 09:34:23] ✓ Story Completed [command-workflow-doctor]: New Custom Command: Workflow Doctor
📋 Decision: Enhanced `workflow-doctor.toml` to specifically check for `ai-workflow` repository components in global agent configuration directories (~/.gemini, etc.). This ensures that symlinks or copies from this specific project are correctly identified and reported.

[2026-01-16 09:35:22] Run #2 [command-poem-7]: ✓ Completed (57.1s)
   Summary: ```

[2026-01-16 09:35:22] 📋 Decision: Created a new `creative` directory for Gemini commands to provide a logical grouping for non-workflow tools, anticipating the addition of more creative commands like `haiku` and `limerick`.

[2026-01-16 09:35:22] 📋 Decision: Implemented the `poem` command with specific prompt instructions to ensure the output is exactly 7 lines and contains no additional conversational text, meeting the requirement for a clean, readable output.

[2026-01-16 09:35:22] 💡 Learning: The Gemini CLI command format (TOML) is highly effective for defining reusable prompts that can be easily shared and installed across different environments using the project's NPX installer.
