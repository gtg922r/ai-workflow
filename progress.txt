[2026-01-14 23:23:50] Run #1 [runner-git]: ✓ Completed (369.7s)
   Summary: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

[2026-01-14 23:23:50] 📋 Decision: Used conventional commit format `feat({story_id}): {story_title}` for automatic commits to align with repository conventions in AGENTS.md

[2026-01-14 23:23:50] 📋 Decision: Made git management optional via `--no-git` flag to support non-git repositories or manual git workflows

[2026-01-14 23:23:50] 💡 Learning: The runner needs to track story changes via `last_story_id` to avoid recreating branches on every iteration for the same story

[2026-01-14 23:28:57] Run #2 [runner-review]: ✓ Completed (305.5s)
   Summary: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

[2026-01-14 23:28:57] 📋 Decision: Used `<verdict>APPROVE|REJECT</verdict>` markers (similar to the existing `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` pattern) for review verdicts to maintain consistency with the codebase's marker-based signal extraction approach.

[2026-01-14 23:33:14] Run #3 [runner-prompts]: ✓ Completed (255.9s)
   Summary: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

[2026-01-14 23:33:14] 📋 Decision: Used `story_type` as the Python field name (rather than `type`) to avoid shadowing the built-in `type()` function, while keeping `type` as the JSON key for cleaner PRD files.

[2026-01-14 23:33:14] 📋 Decision: Template resolution checks project root first (for both type-specific and generic) before bundled templates, allowing users to customize any template by placing it in their project root.

[2026-01-14 23:58:52] Run #1 [installer-npx]: ✓ Completed (279.4s)
   Summary: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

[2026-01-14 23:58:52] 📋 Decision: Used @inquirer/prompts (modern, minimal) instead of inquirer (legacy, larger) for the interactive CLI to keep dependencies lightweight and aligned with the "minimalist" requirement.

[2026-01-14 23:58:52] 📋 Decision: Implemented symlink as the recommended installation method with copy as fallback, allowing users to choose. Symlinks auto-update when the source repo is updated, which is ideal for development workflows.

[2026-01-14 23:58:52] 📋 Decision: Commands are Gemini-specific per the existing repository structure, while skills are cross-agent (Gemini, Claude, Codex) following the provider conventions documented in PROVIDERS.md.

[2026-01-15 00:05:37] Run #2 [runner-ui-polish]: ✓ Completed (403.2s)
   Summary: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

[2026-01-15 00:05:37] 📋 Decision: Created a dedicated console.py module rather than inline styling to provide clean separation of concerns and enable reuse of UI components across the runner codebase.

[2026-01-15 00:05:37] 📋 Decision: Used Rich library for terminal output compatibility - it handles ANSI escape codes and unicode rendering across different terminal emulators automatically.

[2026-01-15 00:05:37] ✓ Story Completed [runner-ui-polish]: Polished Console UI for Runner Ralph
📋 Decision: Created a dedicated console.py module rather than inline styling to provide clean separation of concerns and enable reuse of UI components across the runner codebase.

[2026-01-15 00:08:44] Run #3 [runner-rename-ralph]: ✓ Completed (186.4s)
   Summary: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

[2026-01-15 00:08:44] 📋 Decision: Used "Runner Ralph" as the new name to maintain alliteration and brand consistency with the existing `ralph.py` script filename, while distinguishing from the original "Ralph Wiggum" Simpsons reference.
