# Task: Note Linking & Connections

Help the user discover and create connections between notes in their Obsidian vault.

## User Input
{{args}}

## Instructions

### If a specific note is mentioned:
1. Use `read_note` to understand its content
2. Use `search_notes` to find related notes by:
   - Similar topics/keywords
   - Shared tags
   - Mentioned concepts
3. Suggest specific `[[wiki-links]]` to add

### If asking for general link suggestions:
1. Use `get_notes_info` to identify recently modified notes
2. Analyze content for orphan notes (no incoming/outgoing links)
3. Suggest connections based on content similarity

### For creating bidirectional links:
1. Identify the relationship between notes
2. Suggest link text for both notes
3. Use `write_note` (append mode) to add links if requested

## Output Format

### Suggested Connections for `note-name.md`

**Strong Matches** (high relevance):
- `[[related-note]]` - reason for connection
- `[[another-note]]` - shared concept/tag

**Possible Connections** (explore further):
- `[[maybe-related]]` - potential theme overlap

### Suggested Link Text
Add to current note:
```markdown
## Related
- [[related-note|descriptive text]]
```

## Link Types to Consider
- **See also**: General related topics
- **Parent/child**: Hierarchical relationships
- **Supports/contradicts**: Argumentative connections
- **Prerequisite**: Learning dependencies
- **Example of**: Concrete instances
