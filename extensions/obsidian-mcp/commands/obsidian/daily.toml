# Task: Daily Note Management

Create or update the user's daily note for today.

## Instructions

1. First, check if today's daily note already exists:
   - Common paths: `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, `Daily Notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, or similar
   - Use `list_directory` to discover the daily notes folder pattern if needed

2. If the note exists:
   - Use `read_note` to show its current content
   - Ask if the user wants to add anything

3. If creating a new daily note:
   - Use today's date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) for the filename
   - Include this frontmatter:
     ```yaml
     ---
     date: YYYY-MM-DD
     type: daily
     tags:
       - daily
     ---
     ```
   - Add a heading with the full date
   - Include optional sections: Tasks, Notes, Links

4. If the user provided additional context:
   {{args}}

   Incorporate this into the daily note content.

## Template Structure

```markdown
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
type: daily
tags:
  - daily
---

# Day, Month DD, YYYY

## Tasks
- [ ]

## Notes


## Links

```

Adapt the template based on existing daily note patterns in the vault.
